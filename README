IDMB-TOOLS v0.4
---------------

The IMDB toolkit allows you to query IMDB from the command line and retrieve
titles, cover art, genres, years etc. IMDB can be queried by ID or search
string. Details can be stored in a cache to be accessed later.

The main program in the suite is imdb-get. This is documented in full in the
manpage but essentially has three modes. It can be called with imdb ID and a
set of details to print, in which case it will retrieve those details either
from the cache or IMDB. Secondly, it can be called with a filename in which
case it will look the file up in the cache (resolving symlinks as appropriate
and checking for multiple disks from the same film) and if that fails it will
use the filename to search IMDB. Alternatively it may be used with just a
search string, which will always search IMDB.

All the other programs call imdb-get.

imdb-rename renames files to Title.ext based upon their IMDB data.

imdb-link takes a file and a target directory, looks up the IMDB data for the
file and for each genre in the data creates a link to the file in target/genre/

imdb-update-cache takes a directory and ensures there is IMDB data in the cache
for every file in the directory.

imdb-fxd allows this IMDB system to integrate with the Freevo PVR software.
It exports entries from the cache to the FXD format which freevo uses to
manage stored films. This allows you to group multiple files to one film and
display all the IMDB data and cover art.

Most of the programs are usable without the cache, but will be slow and may
require selecting from a list each time, so a cache is recommended.

Config files
------------

The files /etc/imdbgetrc and $HOME/.imdbgetrc are used to get default options
if they are not specified on the command line. These files are documented in the imdbgetrc(5) manual page.
